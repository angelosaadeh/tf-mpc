Step 1:
Go to mpc.protocols and execute the script generate.py to be able to run the simulations. 

Step 2:
Choose an experiment to run among cosine, cosine variant, 3-estimates and its variant.

Step 3:
Run the script alice.py from one terminal and bob.py from another.

Each run computes the chosen truth-finding algorithm in plain and with mpc and compares their outputs.
